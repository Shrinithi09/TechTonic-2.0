TASK-01 is about creating a landing page with HTML and CSS.

 I have created a section named Why TechTonic. It explains about the idea and support provided to the students to upskill themself in their own chosen field.

I have used tags such as section,header and article. i used css to style the html page and used media query to add responsiveness for mobile phones.

In this process, I have learnt to use semantic html properly and making a responsive page using CSS
